## Description
The purpose of this project is to allow a user to generate a professionally formatted README.md file for a website/app they are creating. This project will run through Node via the command line and bring the user through a series of prompts to answer. Once all prompts are completed, a README.md file will automatically be created, containing the input from the user and formatting it for immediate use without requiring further editing.
